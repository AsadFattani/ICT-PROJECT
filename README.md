# ABOUT

This project, **Speedy Paws**, aims to help users practice, improve, and enhance their typing skills. Whether the goal is to reduce typing errors or increase words per minute, Speedy Paws provides an interactive, user-friendly interface that makes typing practice both enjoyable and efficient. The project includes a variety of features to ensure that users can track their progress in real-time while engaging with the site.<br><br>
The purpose of this project is specifically to assist tech students in conveniently honing their typing skills. As a valuable open-source tool, Speedy Paws is available on GitHub, where the community can contribute and improve the project by adding new features, such as typing levels, progress tracking, and more complex word challenges.


# METHODOLOGY

## Tools, Languages, and Frameworks:
- **JavaScript**: This was used to manage the core functionality of the website, including the timer, word generation, and interaction with the user. JavaScript allowed for dynamic content updates and real-time scoring.
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the website. We ensured semantic HTML tags were used for accessibility and clarity. Asad was responsible for structuring the main page (Index HTML), while Burair and Omer worked on the About and Contact pages.
- **CSS**: We used CSS to style the pages and ensure a visually appealing design. All team members to maintain consistency across the pages worked on CSS collaboratively.


## Development Process:
-	**Planning**: The project began with planning the basic features, such as a timer, word generation, and UI layout.
-	**Prototyping**: We created wireframes for the layout of each page, focusing on ease of navigation and accessibility.
-	**Coding**: Asad started by writing the core JavaScript functions for the timer and word randomization. Burair and Omer collaborated on the HTML and CSS to ensure a cohesive design and structure, with Burair focusing on the Contact and About HTML and Omer assisting in maintaining consistency between these pages.
-	**Testing**: Once the features were implemented, we conducted testing to ensure the timer worked accurately and that the random word generator functioned smoothly. We also ensured that the website was responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

‚ÄÉ
## Challenges:
-	The most significant challenge was ensuring the timer reset function worked seamlessly with the UI updates. After multiple iterations and testing, we successfully implemented the stopwatch countdown that reset every time the user started a new round.
-	Another challenge was maintaining the website's responsiveness on different screen sizes. We used media queries to fine-tune the layout for both desktop and mobile views.

# FEATURES

- **Timer-Based Score:** The website tracks users' performance by timing how long it takes to type the randomly generated words.
- **Changeable Timer:** Users can adjust the length of the timer according to their preferred practice time.
- **Stopwatch Countdown:** The countdown timer adds urgency and encourages users to type faster while minimizing errors.
- **Randomly Generated Words:** This feature keeps the practice session dynamic and varied by providing new words each time, preventing users from memorizing sequences.
- **Highlighted Typed Letters:** As users type, the letters change colour, providing a clear visual indicator of progress and mistakes.
- **Reset Button:** A reset button allows users to quickly restart the timer, offering them a fresh start at any point during the practice.
- **Navigation Buttons:** The website features Home, About, and Contact page buttons for easy access to important sections.
- **Appealing Colour Combinations:** The colour palette used in the project was carefully selected to be easy on the eyes, ensuring a pleasant user experience during prolonged typing sessions.

The project‚Äôs unique design emphasizes simplicity, making it easy for users to focus on their typing without distractions. The automatic timer reset and efficient feedback mechanisms set Speedy Paws apart by offering a straightforward yet effective tool for improving typing skills.
